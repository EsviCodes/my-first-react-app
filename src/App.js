import React from "react";
import logo from "./logo.svg";
import "./App.css";

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <header className="App-header">
        <h1> Hello World </h1>
        <p>
          {" "}
          It's fun that it works like this, but I don't like the fact that my
          theme in JavasScript doesn't show me the difference of an element of
          my normal text
        </p>
      </header>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
